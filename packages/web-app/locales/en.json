The protocol operates autonomously with pre-built algorithms for each game and for the bankroll. The algorithms built into each protocol calculate the necessary reserve held during each period while determining maximum allowed bets to ensure a healthy and stable reserve. All remaining winnings of the platform are distributed back to the players.",
